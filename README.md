Investigating sustainability risks by measuring CO₂ emissions by analysing Global Trends, Impact, and Insights between 2000 and 2025. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Personal Motivation: 
Sustainability is a cause I deeply care about — not just as a global responsibility, but as a guiding principle in how I think about data, technology, and innovation. The climate crisis affects every aspect of our lives, and I believe that data has a powerful role to play in creating awareness and driving change.

This project reflects that belief. By analyzing CO₂ emissions trends across countries, fuel types, and economic indicators, I aimed to turn raw data into actionable insights — insights that can help inform better decisions, whether at a personal, business, or policy level.

In the future, I plan to continue working on climate data projects, focusing on areas such as:

- Renewable energy adoption trends

- Carbon offset initiatives

- Sustainable urban development

- Predictive modeling for environmental impact

By combining my data skills with my commitment to sustainability, I aim to contribute to a more informed and climate-conscious world.

* Project Description:
My project uses the Our World in Data (OWID) CO₂ Emissions Dataset to analyse and visualise global carbon dioxide emissions by country, fuel type, and economic indicators from 2000 to 2025. My goal is to understand emission trends, identify top emitters, and evaluate how emissions correlate with GDP and energy usage.

* Key Features:
- Visualized CO₂ emission trends across top-emitting countries

- Identified top emitters per capita and absolute emissions in 2020 and 2023

- Explored GDP vs. CO₂ emissions relationships

- Analysed fuel-specific emission sources (Coal, Oil, Gas)

- Created clear and interactive plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn

* Key Insights:
China and the U.S. lead in total emissions, while smaller nations dominate per-capita emissions.

High GDP generally correlates with higher emissions, but not always — efficiency and policy play roles.

Emissions from coal remain dominant in countries such as China and India.

Countries with lower emissions often have lower GDP, but some have high efficiency or renewable adoption.

* Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: OWID CO₂ Emissions Data

* Future Improvements:
- Integrate interactive dashboards with Plotly or Dash
- Forecast emissions using regression models
- Compare emissions against renewable energy growth
